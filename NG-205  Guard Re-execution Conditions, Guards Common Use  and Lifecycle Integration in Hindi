Guard Re-execution Conditions

Guards are re-run when:

1.The route parameters change.

2.The query parameters change (depends on config).

3.A different child route is activated.

4.Navigation triggers a new route evaluation.

| Guard                | Common Use                                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CanActivate**      | Authentication check (login/logout).                      |
| **CanActivateChild** | Role-based access for nested routes.                      |
| **CanDeactivate**    | Warn before leaving unsaved form.                         |
| **CanLoad**          | Don’t load modules for unauthorized users.                |
| **CanMatch**         | Dynamic route matching (like A/B testing, feature flags). |


Lifecycle Integration

1.Guards work before components are created or destroyed:

2.Before entering → CanMatch, CanLoad, CanActivate, CanActivateChild

3.Before leaving → CanDeactivate
