Why Angular App loads Slowly?



Application =  Home  + Dashboard  + Admin Pannel + Products 

Application =  Home (2 KB) + Dashboard (300 KB) + Admin Pannel (500 KB) + Products (250 KB) 



In case of Eager Loading -> Application will load : Home + Dashboard + Admin Pannel + Products
                         ->  2 + 300 + 500 + 250 = 1052 KB at Startup

In case of Lazy Loadig   -> Application will load only Home first and then others on Demand.
                         ->  2 KB
