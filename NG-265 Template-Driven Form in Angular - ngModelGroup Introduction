    Template-Driven Form in Angular - ngModelGroup Introduction
</h1>

What is ngModelGroup?

1.ngModelGroup is an Angular directive used in Template-Driven Forms.

2.It is used to group related form controls (inputs, selects, textareas) under a single logical unit.

3.ngModelGroup helps organize form fields that belong together, such as:

Address details

Personal information

Bank details

4.It creates a nested structure inside the form’s data model instead of keeping all values at the same level.

ngModelGroup does not create a new form, but acts as a sub-section of an existing form.

5.All form controls inside an ngModelGroup are treated as child controls of that group.

6.The group automatically tracks the combined state of its child controls, such as:

valid / invalid

touched / untouched

dirty / pristine

7.If any control inside the group is invalid, the entire group becomes invalid.

8.ngModelGroup works only with Template-Driven Forms and cannot be used in Reactive Forms.

9.It is applied to a container element (like div or fieldset), not directly to input elements.

10.Each control inside the group must still use:

ngModel

a unique name attribute

11.The grouped data is returned as a nested object when the form is submitted.

12.This nested structure makes it easier to:

manage complex forms

apply group-level validation

style sections of the form

send structured data to APIs
