    Template-Driven Form in Angular - Where Is ngModelGroup Used
</h1>

Where Is ngModelGroup Used?

1.ngModelGroup is used only in Template-Driven Forms in Angular.

2.It is used inside a form that is already managed by Angular using ngForm.

3.ngModelGroup is applied to a container element, such as:

<div>

<fieldset>

<section>

<ng-container>

4.It is never applied directly to form controls like <input>, <select>, or <textarea>.

5.All form controls that need to be grouped must be placed inside the container that has ngModelGroup.

6.Each control inside the group must still use:

ngModel

a unique name attribute

7.ngModelGroup is commonly used to group:

Address details

Personal information

Contact details

Payment or bank details

Any logically related form section

8.Multiple ngModelGroups can be used inside a single form.

9.ngModelGroup can also be nested inside another ngModelGroup to create multi-level grouping.

10.It works as a child section of the main form and contributes to the form’s overall validity and value.

11.ngModelGroup cannot exist outside a form; it must always be a part of an Angular form.

12.It is not used in Reactive Forms (Reactive Forms use FormGroup instead)
