<h2>
    providedIn: 'root' (App-level Service) in Angular
</h2>

<p>

    1.'root' is the default providedIn value. <br>

    2.Service is registered in the application-level injector. <br>

    3.Angular creates only one instance per Angular app. <br>

    4.That one instance is shared everywhere inside the app.<br>

    5.You don’t need to write providers: [Service] in components anymore. <br>

    6.Angular will make the service available automatically. <br>

    7.This makes your code cleaner and simpler. <br>

    8.Works great for services that hold global state. <br>

    9.Example: authentication service, logging service, user settings service. <br>

    10.If you open the same Angular app twice on one page → each app has its own instance. <br>

    11.Think of it like a big water tank for the whole building. <br>

    12.All rooms (components) use the same tank (same service instance). <br>

    13.Before Angular introduced this, you had to add providers manually → messy. <br>

    14.With 'root', Angular handles tree-shaking: if service isn’t used, it won’t be included in the bundle. <br>

    15.Best practice: Use 'root' for most services. <br>

    Example :

    @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
    export class LoggerService {}
