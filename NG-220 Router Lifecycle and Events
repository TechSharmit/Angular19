Router Lifecycle and Events

Angular Router provides a comprehensive set of lifecycle hooks and events that allow you to respond to navigation
changes and execute custom logic during the routing process.


1. What is the Angular Router?

The Router in Angular is a built-in service that allows navigation between different views or components based on URLs.

It turns your Angular app into a Single-Page Application (SPA) with multiple views.

Instead of reloading pages, the router dynamically swaps components inside a single page.

It also supports lazy loading, guards, route resolvers, and route parameters.


2. What is the Router Lifecycle?

The Router Lifecycle refers to the complete internal process Angular follows whenever you move from one route to
another.

It starts the moment a navigation request begins and ends when the target component is fully activated or when
navigation fails.

This process goes through several phases — such as recognizing the route, checking guards, loading modules, resolving
data, and finally activating components.

At each phase, Angular emits specific Router Events that indicate what’s happening.

3. What are Router Events?

Router Events are notifications (emitted as Observables) that show the progress of navigation.

Each event represents a stage in the router’s lifecycle.

You can use these events to react to navigation — for example:

Show or hide a loading spinner.

Log page views.

Handle errors or cancellations.

Measure lazy-loading performance.

How the Router Lifecycle Works


NavigationStart

RouteConfigLoadStart → RouteConfigLoadEnd (if lazy loading)

GuardsCheckStart → GuardsCheckEnd
↓
ResolveStart → ResolveEnd
↓
ActivationStart → ActivationEnd
↓
NavigationEnd (or Cancel / Error)
