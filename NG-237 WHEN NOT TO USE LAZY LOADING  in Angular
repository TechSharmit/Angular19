WHEN NOT TO USE LAZY LOADING (🚫 Avoid These Situations)

1. Do NOT Lazy Load the Home Page

Home page must open instantly.

Lazy-loading home breaks the user experience.

2. Do NOT Lazy Load Very Small Components

If the component is tiny, lazy-loading creates:

extra network call

extra delay

no performance benefit

Example: A simple header or small card component.

3. When the Feature Is Required Immediately at App Start

Login page

App shell or Layout

Main dashboard for signed-in users.

4. When Components Share Important Services

If a lazy-loaded component needs global shared services:

may create duplicate service instances.

Better to eagerly load shared/common components.

5. When There Are Too Many Lazy-Loaded Chunks

Overdoing lazy loading creates:

too many network requests

performance issues

poor caching

Balance is important.

6. When SEO Requires Content On First Load

If page content must appear instantly for SEO:

avoid lazy loading.

Example: A blog landing page in SSR apps.

7. When User Flow Depends on Speed

If the user must switch quickly between pages:

loading time for lazy chunks creates a delay.

Example: POS systems, Finance apps, Chat apps.
