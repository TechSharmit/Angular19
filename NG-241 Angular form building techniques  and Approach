Angular's Approach to Forms

Angular provides two distinct form-building techniques:

(A) Template-Driven Forms

Form logic is mainly in the HTML template

Uses ngModel for two-way data binding

Suitable for simpler forms

More declarative and easier for beginners

Relies on Angular directives automatically tracking state

(B) Reactive Forms

Form logic is written in TypeScript

Uses explicit FormControl, FormGroup, FormArray classes

More scalable and predictable

Better testability and performance

Best for complex, dynamic forms
