What is Lazy Loading?

1. Lazy Loading means loading code only when it’s needed.

Not all parts of the app load at startup — only when user navigates to them.

2. It improves performance by reducing the initial bundle size.

3. It speeds up the first-page load time (faster initial rendering).

4. It helps large applications load faster and feel lightweight.

5. In Angular, lazy loading is done at the route level (feature-based).

6. Angular 19 uses loadComponent() and loadChildren() for lazy loading.

7. Modules aren’t required anymore — components can be lazy-loaded directly.

8. Lazy loaded routes load their components only when the route is visited.

9. This avoids loading unused components at initial app startup.

10. It reduces memory usage by loading code in smaller chunks.

11. It supports code splitting — each route gets its own JS file.

12. It minimizes network load by loading code on demand.

13. Ideal for large sections like: Admin panel, Dashboard, Reports, etc.

14. Improves user experience by making the app feel snappier.

15. Lazy Loading is the opposite of Eager Loading (where everything loads upfront).

16. Can be combined with Preloading Strategies for balanced performance.

17. Helps maintain scalability in medium to large applications.

18. Highly recommended for routes not required on the first load.

19. Works seamlessly in standalone Angular apps (Angular 16+).

20. Lazy loading reduces the time-to-interactive (TTI) of your application.
