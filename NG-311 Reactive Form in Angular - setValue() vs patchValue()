<h1>
    Reactive Form in Angular - setValue() vs patchValue()
</h1>

<hr>

🔹 setValue()

setValue() is a method used to update the entire value of a form at once.
Angular expects the complete form structure to be provided when using this method.

In simple words:

When you use setValue(), Angular assumes you know every field of the form and you are setting all of them together.

🔹 patchValue()

patchValue() is a method used to update only selected form fields.
Angular allows partial updates without affecting other fields.

In simple words:

When you use patchValue(), Angular understands that you want to update only some fields, not the whole form.

2️⃣ Strictness of Data Matching

🔹 setValue()

setValue() is strict by design.
The object passed to it must exactly match the form structure.

Every control in the form must be present

Control names must match exactly

No extra or missing controls are allowed

If this rule is violated, Angular throws an error.

This strict behavior ensures data accuracy and consistency.

🔹 patchValue()

patchValue() is lenient and flexible.

Angular updates only the fields that are present in the object and ignores the rest.

Missing controls are ignored

Extra fields do not cause errors

Structure does not have to match exactly

This makes it suitable for real-world dynamic data.


3️⃣ Error Handling Behavior

🔹 setValue()

If any form control is missing or incorrectly named, Angular immediately throws a runtime error.

This happens because Angular assumes:

“You are updating the full form — so every field must be accounted for.”

This behavior helps catch programming mistakes early, especially when working with APIs.

🔹 patchValue()

patchValue() does not throw errors for missing controls.

Angular simply:

Updates matching controls

Skips unmatched ones

Continues execution normally

This makes it safer when form structure or incoming data is uncertain.


4️⃣ Partial vs Complete Updates

🔹 setValue()

Designed only for complete form updates.

It cannot be used when:

Only one or two fields need updating

Data is incomplete

Form controls change dynamically

Using setValue() for partial updates is not allowed.

🔹 patchValue()

Designed specifically for partial updates.

It is ideal when:

Updating a single field (e.g., name)

Updating nested fields

Applying user edits without resetting other values

This flexibility is its biggest strength.
