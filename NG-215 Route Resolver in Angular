1️⃣ What is a Route Resolver?

1.A Route Resolver is a feature in Angular that fetches data before a route is loaded.

2.It helps ensure that when a component is displayed, its data is already available.

3.Think of it as preparing data before showing the page.

2️⃣ Why Do We Need a Resolver?

1.Normally, we fetch data inside the component using ngOnInit().

2.This causes the component to load first, and then data appears after a short delay.

3.With a resolver, Angular waits for the data to be ready before loading the route.

4.This removes the “loading” flicker and improves the user experience.


3️⃣ When Does a Resolver Run?

1.It runs before the route is activated.

2.Angular will pause the navigation until the resolver finishes.

3.Once the data is ready → the route is activated → the component receives the data.


4️⃣ Key Benefits

✅ No more “Loading…” screens
✅ Data is ready as soon as the page opens
✅ Cleaner, more professional user experience
✅ Great for API-driven pages or SEO-friendly apps

5️⃣ How Does It Work (Flow)

User clicks on a route →
