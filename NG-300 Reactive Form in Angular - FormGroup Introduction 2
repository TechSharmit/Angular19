<h1>
    Reactive Form in Angular - FormGroup Introduction
</h1>

A. Validation Behavior

1.FormGroup becomes invalid if any child control is invalid

2.Supports group-level validation

3.Used for validations involving multiple fields

Example:

Password and Confirm Password must match
→ Validation applied at FormGroup level

B. FormGroup Status States

FormGroup can have the following states:

1.VALID – all fields are correct

2.INVALID – at least one field is incorrect

3.PENDING – async validation is running

4.DISABLED – form is disabled

C. User Interaction Tracking

1.FormGroup tracks user interaction such as:

2.touched / untouched – user interacted or not

3.dirty / pristine – data changed or not

Real-world example:

Form opened but not edited → pristine

User types something → dirty

D. Parent–Child Relationship

1.FormGroup acts as a parent

2.FormControls inside it are children

3.Child errors automatically affect the parent FormGroup

Real-world example:

If one section fails, the entire form fails

E.Relation with AbstractControl

1.FormGroup extends AbstractControl

2.It inherits common properties like:

value

valid / invalid

touched / dirty

3.Allows uniform handling of all form elements
