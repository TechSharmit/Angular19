What Are Angular Forms?

Introduction

In web applications, forms are used to collect user input such as login details, registration data, search queries,
payment information, etc.

Angular provides a powerful and structured way to build, manage, and validate forms in applications.

Definition

Angular Forms refer to Angular’s system for handling user inputs through HTML forms.

They allow developers to:

1.Collect data from users

2.Track input values and changes

3.Validate data

4.Respond to form events

5.Submit and process final output

Angular offers built-in APIs, directives, and classes to manage forms in a clean, scalable, reactive way.

Why Forms Matter in Angular

Forms are central to many features in modern web apps:

1.User authentication (login, registration)

2.Checkout and payment

3.Feedback and surveys

4.Search functionality

5.Data-entry dashboards

Angular forms help make these tasks:

1.Easier to build

2.Easier to maintain

3.More robust and structured
