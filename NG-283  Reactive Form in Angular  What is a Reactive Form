1️⃣ What is a Reactive Form?


1.A Reactive Form is a way to create and manage forms using code (TypeScript) instead of writing everything in HTML.

2.You control the form from the component file, not the template.

3.Angular keeps the form data, validation, and state in one place.


2️⃣ Why Do We Need Reactive Forms?

Problem without Reactive Forms:

1.Hard to track form values

2.Validation becomes messy

3.Difficult to handle complex forms

Benefits:

1.Full control over form logic

2.Easier validation

3.Better for large and dynamic forms

4.Clean and predictable behavior


3️⃣ Real-Life Analogy

📝 Job Application Form

1.Each input field = a question (name, email, experience)

2.Form group = the entire application

3.Validation = rules (email must be valid, name required)

Submit button = send application

Angular acts like a form manager checking everything before submission.
