    Reactive Form in Angular - FormGroup Introduction
</h1>

(A) What is FormGroup?

(1) FormGroup represents a collection of multiple form fields
(2) It groups related form controls into one logical unit
(3) It defines the structure of form data
(4) It is mainly used to create complete forms

Real-world example:
A registration form with Name, Email, and Password together is one FormGroup.

(2) Why do we need FormGroup?

(1) FormControl manages only one input field
(2) Real applications contain multiple related inputs
(3) FormGroup helps manage all fields together
(4) It allows validating and submitting the entire form at once

Simple idea:

When a form has many fields, FormGroup keeps everything organized.


(3) What does FormGroup contain?

(1) FormControl – for single inputs
(2) FormGroup – for nested groups
(3) FormArray – for dynamic lists of fields

Real-world example:
Profile Form → Personal Info (FormGroup), Address Info (FormGroup), Skills (FormArray)


(4) Role of FormGroup in a Form

(1) Collects values from all form fields
(2) Tracks overall validity of the form
(3) Controls form state such as enable, disable, and reset
(4) Acts as the main container for reactive forms


(5) FormGroup Data Structure

(1) FormGroup value is always an object
(2) Each key represents a form field name
(3) Each value represents user input

Real-world example:
A filled application form converted into structured data.
