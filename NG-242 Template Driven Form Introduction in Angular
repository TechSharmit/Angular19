1️⃣ Introduction

1.Template-Driven Forms are forms where most of the form logic is written inside the HTML template.

2.Suitable for simple to moderately complex forms.

3.Based on Angular’s FormsModule.

4.Uses two-way data binding extensively.

2️⃣ Key Characteristics

1.Form model is created implicitly by Angular.

2.Uses ngModel for mapping data between component and view.

3.HTML-driven and declarative in nature.

4.Minimal TypeScript code required.

5.Easy to understand for beginners.

3️⃣ Required Module

1.Must import FormsModule from @angular/forms in the module.

2.No need for ReactiveFormsModule.

4️⃣ Core Directives

1.ngModel – creates FormControl & binds data.

2.ngForm – represents the entire form.

3.ngModelGroup – defines grouped controls inside a form.

4.Template reference variables like #myForm="ngForm" used for accessing form instance.

5️⃣ Two-Way Data Binding

1.Achieved with [(ngModel)].

2.Automatically syncs input value ↔ component variable.

3.Eliminates manual event handling for inputs.

6️⃣ Form Model Behavior

Angular automatically:

1.Creates FormControls

2.Tracks value changes

3.Maintains validity

4.Updates form state

5.No explicit form model creation is required.


7️⃣ Advantages

1.Very easy to implement.

2.Clean, readable HTML.

3.Great for simple forms.

4.Easy for beginners to understand.

5.Quick development for small modules.


8️⃣ Limitations

1.Lack of scalability for complex forms.

2.Hard to unit test.

3.Custom validators require boilerplate directives.

4.Complex conditional logic is harder to implement.

5.Less predictable than Reactive Forms.


9️⃣ Best Use Cases

1.Contact forms

2.Login forms

3.Registration with few fields

4.Feedback forms

5.Simple data-entry screens
