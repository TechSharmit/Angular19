    Comparative Chart for proviedIn Values - 'root', 'any' and 'platform'
</h2>

<p>
    'root' → one instance for the whole app.
    (This is the Default Provided in Value)

    'any' → one instance per lazy-loaded feature. 
    (If no Lazy-Loaded features in the application then it will work same as 'root')

    'platform' → one instance shared across all Angular apps on the page.
    (If there is no multiple application then it will work same as 'root')

    Analogy:

    Root = one tank per building - one instance for the whole app.

    Any = one tank per floor - one instance per lazy-loaded feature.

    Platform = one tank for the whole city - one instance shared across all Angular apps on the page.

    Use 'root' for most services.

    Use 'any' for isolated features.

    Use 'platform' for multiple Angular apps.
