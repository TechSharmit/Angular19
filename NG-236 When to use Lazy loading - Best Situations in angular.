WHEN TO USE LAZY LOADING (✔ Best Situations)

1. When a Feature Is Not Needed at App Startup

Any part of the app that users do not see immediately.

Example: Admin Panel, Analytics, User Profile.

2. When the Feature Is Large or Heavy

Pages with many components, charts, tables, or services.

Reduces the main bundle size significantly.

3. When a Section Has Its Own Sub-Pages

Dashboard → Home / Reports / Settings

User → Profile / Orders / Wishlist

Perfect use-case for loadChildren().

4. When Only a Small Percentage of Users Use That Feature

Example:

Admin pages (1% users)

Support pages

Advanced settings

Reduces unnecessary load for majority users.

5. When You Want Faster Initial Load (Performance Boost)

Lazy loading helps pages render quicker on slow internet.

Crucial for mobile users and SEO performance.

6. When the Feature Is Optional

Contact page

About page

Privacy policy

Terms & conditions

All good cases for loadComponent().

7. When Building Large, Scalable Apps

Enterprise apps

Multi-role apps (Admin/Customer/Seller)

Helps maintain a clean, modular architecture.
