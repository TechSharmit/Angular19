Why Do We Need ngModelGroup?

1.In real-world forms, inputs are not independent; many fields are logically related.

Without ngModelGroup, all form values are stored at the same level, making the form data flat and unorganized.

2.A flat structure becomes hard to read, manage, and debug as the form grows.

3.ngModelGroup allows developers to group related fields together, improving form structure and clarity.

4.It helps create a nested data object, which better represents real-world data models.

5.Grouping makes it easier to send structured data to backend APIs, which usually expect nested objects.

6.ngModelGroup enables section-wise validation, such as validating the entire address or profile section at once.

7.Without grouping, validation logic must be applied individually to each control, which is repetitive.

8.It allows section-level styling, such as highlighting an entire group when it is invalid.

9.ngModelGroup improves maintainability by keeping related controls together.

10.It makes complex forms easier to understand for both developers and learners.

11.Grouping supports scalability, allowing new fields to be added to a section without restructuring the whole form.

12.It provides a clear separation of concerns within a single form.

13.ngModelGroup helps align the UI structure with the data structure used in the application.
