Guard Execution Order

When navigating, Angular checks guards in this order:

1.CanMatch → checks if route should be considered.

2.CanLoad → checks if lazy module should be loaded.

3.CanActivateChild → checks child routes.

4.CanActivate → checks if route can be activated.

5.CanDeactivate → checks before leaving current route.

Navigation continues only if all guards return true (or a valid UrlTree redirect).


Guard Evaluation Rules

1.Guards run in order of appearance in the route configuration.

2.If any guard returns false, navigation is cancelled.

3.If any guard returns UrlTree, navigation redirects to that URL.

4.Angular waits for async guards (Observable or Promise) to resolve before continuing.
