Angular Route Guards — Complete Theory Summary

1. What Are Route Guards?

Route Guards are interfaces provided by Angular’s RouterModule.

They control navigation: whether a user can access, leave, or load a particular route.

Used for authentication, authorization, data protection, and user flow control.



2. Purpose of Route Guards

They help in:

Protecting routes from unauthorized access.

Preventing navigation away from unsaved changes.

Restricting module loading based on conditions.

Managing dynamic or conditional routing.

Controlling how and when a route should be matched or activated.

4. Return Types (What a Guard Can Return)

A guard can return:

boolean → true (allow) / false (deny)

UrlTree → redirect to another route

Observable<boolean | UrlTree> → for async logic

Promise<boolean | UrlTree> → for async logic
