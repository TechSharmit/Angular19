Ways to Lazy Load in Angular 19

1. Lazy Loading Using loadComponent()

✔ Detailed Pointers:

1.Used only for standalone components (Angular 15+).

2.Loads a single file + template only when route is visited.

3.Angular creates a separate JS chunk for that component.

4.Keeps initial bundle extremely small.

5.Perfect for small pages with no nested routing.

6.Makes routing file simple and clean.

Faster than loadChildren() because:

1.It downloads only one component, not a route tree.

2.Useful for content-only pages (About, Contact, Terms).

3.Supports route-level guards like canActivate.

4.Useful for SEO-focused apps where multiple pages are not connected.

2. Lazy Loading Using loadChildren()

✔ Detailed Pointers:

1.Used for feature sections that contain multiple pages.

2.Suitable for Admin panels, User dashboards, Settings.

3.Lazy loads an entire route group, not just a component.

4.Enables nested routes inside the lazy-loaded area.

5.Organizes large projects into logical feature folders.

6.Keeps main routing file clean and maintainable.

7.Angular loads one combined JS bundle for all child routes.

8.Reduces code duplication across related routes.

9.Essential when multiple pages share:

Guards

Layouts

Resolvers

UI shells

Works with standalone route files (*.routes.ts).
